## My process

### Built with

- HTML.
- JavaScript.
- CSS.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) + Front-end framework
- NodeJS.


### What I learned

This project helped me to put into practice my React-Bootstrap skills. It allowed me to create from scratch a solution dividing an element in components. And adding styling from this framework. At the same time, I was able to rewiew some features for CSS styling, and hover states.



### Continued development

I plan to keep working on projects and challenges to hone up my skills in React, Bootstrap, JavaScript and other Front-end technologies.

### Useful resources

- [React-Bootstrap Documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me define my components for this asset. I could divide items, and use suggested styling.
- [Hover Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - This is a "indepth" resource for CSS, specific to the hover selector, and it provides good examples on how to use it.
